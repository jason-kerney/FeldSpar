It can be a *.dll or a *.exe file--report-location [--r] <string>: This flag indicates that a JSON report is to be generated at the given location--verbosity [--v] <string>: This sets the verbosity level for the run. Possible levels are: ["Max"; "Results"; "Errors"; "Detail"]--auto-loop [--al]: This makes the command contiuously run executing on every compile.--usereporters [--ur]: This enables the use of reporters configured in the test--pause [--p]: This makes the console wait for key press inorder to exit. This is automaticly in effect if "auto-loop" is used--help [-h|/h|/help|/?]: display this list of options.```##Goals### 1. Be as purely functional as possible### 2. Enforce Test Isolation* _(done)_ Tests run in isolated memory space* _(done)_ Test execution order is indeterminate### 3. Enable Gold Standard Testing as a Framework Feature* _(done)_ Enable use of Approval Libraries in a functional manner* _(done)_ Enable Configuration to setup global reporters for test Assembly.### 4. Implement Theory Based Testing* _(done)_ Theory test type### 5. Integrate with visual studio### 6. Create Console Runner* _(done)_ Create parameterized console* _(done)_ Allow Console to auto detect changes and rerun all tests### 7. Provide out of editor gui runner* _(done)_ Build CLR integration layer for the Engine* _(done)_ Create a WPF viewer in C#* Move View Models to the FeldSpar main project and convert them to F#* Create WPF GUI runner in F# ### 3. Generate Documentation* Add XML Comments* _(done)_ Add Read Me## Design Considerations### **NO** Exception Driven Workflows> OO based test frameworks use `Assert` to designate a failure. This works because it generates an exception which forces an early exit without `if` `then` `else` or `case` statements.> Functional programming has a better way. In F# that way is called a workflow. Every test **must** return a valid type indicating its success or failure. In FeldSpar that type is a `TestResult`.> Exceptions happen. The Framework will handle them, however they should be an exception to the normal rule.### Ignored Tests are failing tests> In other frameworks an ingnored test simply does not run and reports itself as being in a third state if _ignored_. Ignoring a test is a failure. It is a failure of either the test or test methodologies.> By having an ignored state you increase complexity of the system because there are three states of a test.> Feld Spar tackles this by having only 2 states of a test. Success or Failure. Failures allow you to have a reason for failure, which will be `Ignored` for an ignored test.### Favor Intention> .Net attributes are not immediately obvious when your program execution depends on them. If you find a method that conforms to the test signature but lacks the attribute was the attribute removed?> I wanted a test framework that made a test method as obviously indented to be a test.> I also choose a convention based approach whenever I was able to without forfeiting clarity## Feld Spar?> Vikings navigated using solar navigation. This presented a problem when it was foggy, overcast or rainy. However they were very successful at navigation despite these limitations. Myth states that the Vikings had a magic [Sun Stone](http://news.discovery.com/earth/rocks-fossils/viking-sunstone-shipwreck-130311.htm) that enabled them to navigate during the worst of weather.  > Recent discoveries have shown that the Viking Sun Stone was not a myth. It was a type of stone known as Icelantic Spar which is in tern a type of Feld Spar.  > Unit tests guide us out of the worst situations. And so I named my framework after the tool that guided the Vikings out of the worst weather.
